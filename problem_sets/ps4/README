STRUCTURE OF ASSIGNMENT:
------------------------

1. Problem_Set_4___Mattias_Lazda.pdf contains a write-up, summarizing all of the work that I did in chronological order. 
2. Problem_Set_4.ipynb contains the raw code used to carry out this assignment. 
3. JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PDF_PS4.pdf is a PDF version of the ipynb file, so that you don't have to open a new jupyter notebook if you do not want to. Note that some symbols may be missing (i.e. lambda) due to the pdf converter being unable to interpret them.
